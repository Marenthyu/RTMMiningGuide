            <h1>RTM basic Mining Guide</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Required Reading</h2>
            <p>Welcome! I assume you are here to get into Raptoreum Mining. You are free to just skip to the steps to
                get going,
                but don't blame me or come asking about things explained here. Be sure to understand what you're dealing
                with -
                Cryptocurrencies are volatile and you can lose your investment. <b>This is not financial or legal
                    advice.
                    Contact a finance person or lawyer for that.</b></p>
            <p>Long Story Short: You can use your Computer Power to get virtual Money. Raptoreum specifically is best
                mined with CPUs that have a large L3 Cache with GPUs being way less efficient.</p>
            <p><b>About Randomness:</b> GhostRider (the algorithm used for Raptoreum) is also random at its core - <b>
                This means you will not get a stable hashrate. Your hashrate may be lower than expected.
            </b></p>
            <p>Old CPUs won't give you much back, so I recommend against going with anything older than 4 years or
                lower-end CPUs.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>First Things first: You will need a <b>Wallet</b> to store your earnings. This can be done online or
                locally. I highly recommend
                a local Wallet to keep your stuff private. This Guide will show <b>Raptoreum Core</b>. Go ahead and <a
                        href="https://github.com/Raptor3um/raptoreum/releases/latest" target="_blank">Download it from
                    GitHub</a>.
                (Assuming you are on windows, you will want the file named <b>raptoreum-x.x.x.x-win64-setup.exe</b> -
                Start it after downloading and follow the installation Wizard.)</p>
            <p>Once completed, open "Raptoreum Core" - your <b>Wallet</b>. It will then ask you where to store the
                Blockhain information. It will then go ahead and <b>synchronize</b> the blockchain to your computer -
                <b>This will take a long time. This is not yet the mining process.</b> It will look like this: </p>
            <img src="https://lowee.de/raptoreum-qt_2021-11-14_20-36-01.png" style="width: 50%">
            <p>You can click on <b>Hide</b> to already use the application, but you will not see any up-to-date info
                about the Blockchain before it is fully synced. At the time of writing, the initial Sync for me took
                about 5 hours. You may be interested in using the provided <b>bootstrap.zip</b> File to finish quicker,
                but I won't explain that here. For now, let's move on.</p>
            <h3>Your receiving Address</h3>
            <p>By starting up Raptoreum Core, the app will have generated a default wallet. You can (and should) encrypt
                it with the <b>Settings</b> Menu, but we can also continue without it.</p>
            <p>Click on <b>File</b>, then <b>Receiving Addresses...</b>. This is where you can see your Addresses you
                can use to <b>Receive RTM</b>. Click on <b>New</b> in the bottom left, enter any <b>Label</b> you would
                like (for example "FlockPool Mining") and click <b>OK</b>. Congratulations! You now have a receiving
                Address you can use for Mining. Write it down somewhere!</p>
            <h3>The Pool</h3>
            <p>You could now start mining with the Wallet itself, but it will be very inefficient and you most likely
                won't solve a block on your own. Thus, choose a <b>Mining Pool</b> of your choice. I recommend <a
                        href="https://flockpool.com/" target="_blank">FlockPool</a>. Click on <b>Start Mining</b> on
                their Website,
                enter your <b>Receiving Address</b>, any arbitrary <b>Worker Name</b> you want as well as an optional
                <b>Password</b> for this Pool. This Password is used to change your minimum Payout Threshold later.
                Click on the
                <svg aria-hidden="true" data-testid="ContentCopyRoundedIcon" focusable="false"
                     style="height: 1rem; color: white;"
                     viewBox="0 0 24 24">

                </svg>
                Copy Icon and note down the generated config. You'll need it in a bit.
            </p>
            <h3>The Miner</h3>
            <p>
                Now you just need your <b>Mining Software</b> - if you want to squeeze out every last penny, go compile
                it yourself and find one that fits you perfect; Otherwise, just go <a
                    href="https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2/releases/latest" target="_blank">here</a> and
                download the <b>cpuminer-gr-x.x.x.x-x86_64_windows.7z</b>
                File. Your Webbrowser will most likely warn you that the file is dangerous - this is technically correct
                as mining software is often abused. But since that is what we want, you can accept the risk. In Chrome,
                Open <b>All Downloads</b> by Pressing <b>CTRL+J</b>, then selecting to keep the File Anyway and
                confirming the secondary warning.
            </p>
            <p>Once the file is downloaded, Extract it using an App like <a href="https://7-zip.org" target="_blank">7zip</a>.
                Open Up the <b>config.json</b> File in a Text Editor like <a
                        href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a> and replace the contents with the
                configuration you generated above. You can also toy with the other options if you want to. Save the file
                and close Notepad++.</p>
            <p><b>Congratulations!</b> You are now ready to Mine! Just launch the cpuminer.bat file as Administrator
                (right-click it, then select <b>Run as Administrator</b>)!</p>
            <div class="alert alert-danger"><b>NOTICE:</b> The first time you start the Miner, it will tune itself to
                your specific setup for about 2 and a half hours. It may take a while, but is worth it to optimize your
                Mining Efforts! <b>Do NOT interrupt this process or it will start from scratch!</b></div>
            <p>After tuning completes, mining will start. The tuning will not need to be redone once finished, unless
                you delete anything.</p>
            <p>After a few minutes of Mining, you can head to your Pool's Website, enter your Receiving Address and see
                your progress - with FlockPool, it should show after about 30 seconds of mining or when you get your
                first share. FlockPool will then send you your payment twice a day at 8AM and 8PM UTC, if you are above
                the Payout Threshold that you can change with the password you set.</p>
            <p>Happy Mining!</p>
